# Armstrong Number Checker

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple C program that checks whether a given 3-digit number is an Armstrong number or not.  
**An Armstrong** number is a number whose sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the original number.

Example:
153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153 → Armstrong Number

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. Read a number from the user.
2. Store the original number.
3. Extract each digit using modulo operation.
4. Calculate the cube of each digit.
5. Add all the cubes.
6. Compare the sum with the original number.
7. Display whether the number is Armstrong or not.
